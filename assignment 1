Step-by-Step Instructions to Create a Git Repository
Step 1: Install Git
If you haven't already installed Git, download and install it from git-scm.com.

Step 2: Open Command Line Interface
On Windows, you can use Command Prompt or Git Bash.
On macOS or Linux, open the Terminal.
Step 3: Navigate to Your Desired Directory
Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to create your Git repository. For example:

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/directory
Step 4: Create a New Git Repository
Use the following command to create a new Git repository named with your enrollment number (replace YOUR_ENROLLMENT_NUMBER with your actual enrollment number):

bash
Copy code
git init YOUR_ENROLLMENT_NUMBER
Step 5: Navigate into the Repository
Change into the newly created directory:

bash
Copy code
cd YOUR_ENROLLMENT_NUMBER
Step 6: Create Folders for Assignments
Create two folders named Assignment_1 and Assignment_2:

bash
Copy code
mkdir Assignment_1
mkdir Assignment_2
Step 7: Verify the Structure
You can verify that the folders have been created by listing the contents of the directory:

bash
Copy code
ls
You should see:

Copy code
Assignment_1
Assignment_2
Step 8: Add Files to the Repository (Optional)
If you want to add files to your folders, you can create files using a text editor or the command line. For example:

bash
Copy code
touch Assignment_1/example_file.txt
touch Assignment_2/example_file.txt
Step 9: Stage and Commit Changes
To stage the changes and commit them to the repository, use the following commands:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with Assignment folders"
Step 10: (Optional) Create a Remote Repository
If you want to push your local repository to a remote server (like GitHub), you can create a new repository on GitHub and then link it:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/YOUR_ENROLLMENT_NUMBER.git
git push -u origin master
Documenting the Steps in a Word File
Open Microsoft Word (or any word processor).
Create a New Document.
Title the Document: "Steps to Create a Git Repository".
Write the Steps: Copy the steps outlined above into the document.
Format the Document: Use headings, bullet points, and numbering for clarity.
Save the Document: Save the file with an appropriate name, such as "Git_Repository_Steps.docx".
